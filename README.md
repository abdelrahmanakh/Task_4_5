=============================================================================
To use this program You must have the knowledge about the Machine code.
Each line of code consists of 4 Characters: ORXY

right after hitting enter

On the left side you will find the memory Matrix it is 16x16
each cell can hold 2 hex characters

with each cell holding only 2 hex characters

below this is the Error, output and IR CP displays.

below this in the leftmost is another input box for to allow the user to
modify the memory to start at any position in the RAM of his choice

form 00 to FF 

then run each step button which enables the execution after each enter you 
hit

then clear memory and clear register to make their cells hold the default 
which is 00

Then upload to allow user to upload instruction files.

instruction file must be written as command per line each command 4 char.
